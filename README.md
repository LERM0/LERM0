# Lermo Story

When I was a kid, I faced a hard time in the education system. I felt like a fish trying to climb a tree, and the education system did not offer me any help; instead, it kept pushing me away, killing my dream, and limiting my potential.

Access to a good education system was often denied to people like me, especially those from underprivileged backgrounds. I spent 10 years trying to hack the education system by learning everything by myself from the internet. I could learn coding from Google Experts, join free courses, and listen to world leaders via TED. I discovered "The Power of Knowledge."

My personal journey compels me to venture into my own startup, with the vision of crafting an inclusive education system that truly belongs to everyone. I devoted 8 years to collaborating with startups, comprehending their operations and technical intricacies to help me jumpstart my startup. In 2020, initial my own Opensource project called Lermo. This project is my passion my dream and my hope. My project might be a success or failure I don't know, but I hope this project is a part of revolutionizing in the education system.

"Picture a groundbreaking education system that transcends barriers, offering boundless access to knowledge for all. It embodies inclusivity and equality, empowering learners worldwide to embrace their potential and pursue dreams without constraints. In this educational utopia, knowledge fuels curiosity, ignites intellect, and fosters a love for learning, shaping a brighter, enlightened future for humanity. Let's dare to envision and strive for an education system that belongs to everyoneâ€”a beacon of hope and empowerment, inspiring generations to flourish and make a positive impact."
